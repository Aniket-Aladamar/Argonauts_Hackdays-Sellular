Debate Chat App

- Our app is created to promote healthy debate about various topics among people to reap its various benefits. People can connect over chat to debate about new topics everyday.
- There are two roles that can be assumed on our app: User and Admin.
- The admin role enables daily assignment of new topics for the debate.
- The user role enables people to connect and discuss new and fun topics assigned everyday.
- The user is first required to sign in with email ID, username, password and role to use the app. 
- The app authenticates the user.
- Duplicate usernames and email IDs are detected and appropriate messages are displayed.
- They will get connected via a group once they register. 
- When they login, they can see the topic for the day on login and start chatting. Whereas when the admin logs in, he/she can set a new topic.
- We have designed the front and backend of the app.
