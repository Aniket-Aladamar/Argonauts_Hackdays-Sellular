Debate Chat App

Our app is created to promote healthy debate about various topics among people to reap its various benefits. People can connect over chat to debate about new topics everyday.
There are two roles that can be assumed on our app: User and Admin.
The admin role enables daily assignment of new topics for the debate.
The user role enables people to connect and discuss new and fun topics assigned everyday.
The user is first required to sign in with email ID, username, password and role to use the app. 
The app authenticates the user.
 Duplicate usernames and email IDs are detected and appropriate messages are displayed.
They will get connected via a group once they register. 
When they login, they can see the topic for the day on login and start chatting. Whereas when the admin logs in, he/she can set a new topic.
We have designed the front and backend of the app.
